# Lisps are pretty easy to make, right?

I dunno, I felt like making a Lisp language.  Mostly takes inspiration from Scheme.  Right now supports:
 - Integers/Floats/Strings/Lists/Bools
 - User-defined functions
 - First-class Functions/Closures
 - Macros (sorta, kinda, idk)
 
TODO:
 - Better error handling (instead of just asserting)
 - Make it embeddable, usable as scripting lang?
 - Better macro system, quoting
 - Better list handling
 - Variadic functions
 - Type checking (check if something is a number, string, etc.)
 - User-defined structs
 - Efficiency, optimisation, less memory
